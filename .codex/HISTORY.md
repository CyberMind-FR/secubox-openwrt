# SecuBox Dev History (Codex Notes)

- **2025-12-18 – Theme Foundations**  
  Added `secubox/common.css` (design tokens) + SecuNav component.

- **2025-12-20 – Dashboard Revamp**  
  Dashboard got hero chips, module grid, and API auto-refresh.

- **2025-12-24 – Modules + Monitoring Upgrade**  
  Modules view has filter tabs, responsive cards, and live stats.  
  Monitoring view now renders SVG spark lines with poll-based updates.

- **2025-12-26 – Alerts + Settings Refresh**  
  Alerts converted to chip header + stats cards.  
  Settings adopted shared layout and is now theme-aware.

- **2025-12-28 – Theme & Menu Fixes**  
  Every view initializes `Theme.init`.  
  Navigation tabs respond to dark/light/cyberpunk palettes.  
  Monitoring menu simplified (no `/overview` tab).  
  CSS updated so chip headers stay on a single row (with responsive wrap).
