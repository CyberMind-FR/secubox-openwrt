## 🔍 Why These Documents Were Archived

### Completion Reports
Historical completion reports are archived after project milestones are achieved. They provide valuable project history but are not needed for daily development.

### Design Documents
Design documents are archived once features are fully implemented and deployed. The implementation details are now documented in the main guides.

### Issue Trackers
Build issue documentation is archived once problems are resolved and solutions are incorporated into [DEVELOPMENT-GUIDELINES.md](../DEVELOPMENT-GUIDELINES.md) and [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).
