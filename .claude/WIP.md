  - Updated `mailctl webmail configure` to use proxy instead of direct SSL

- **Mail Send 451 "Temporary lookup failure"** — RESOLVED (2026-02-06)

- **Postfix/Dovecot Maildir Path Alignment** — DONE (2026-02-07)
  - Root cause: Postfix delivered to `/home/vmail/$domain/$user/new/` but Dovecot looks in `~/Maildir/new/`
  - Emails were delivered but invisible in Roundcube

### Master/Slave CDN Architecture (User Vision)

> "multipoint CDN for SSL dependencies, root/master with *.sb, xxx.sb slaved, first peek meshed, submastering/multimixslaving"

Target architecture for service mirroring:
1. **Root Master** owns wildcard domain `*.secubox.io` (or similar)
2. **Slave Nodes** get delegated subdomains (`node1.secubox.io`)
3. **First Peek** = service discovery auto-registers in mesh
4. **Mirror Cascade** = master pushes exposure config to slaves
5. **Submastering** = hierarchical delegation (master → submaster → slaves)

Required components:
- Dynamic DNS delegation with zone transfer
- Service mirroring via reverse proxy chaining
- Gossip-based exposure config sync
- Trust hierarchy with certificate delegation

### Communication Layer (v1.0)

- `secubox-voip` — Asterisk micro-PBX
- `secubox-matrix` — Conduit Matrix server
