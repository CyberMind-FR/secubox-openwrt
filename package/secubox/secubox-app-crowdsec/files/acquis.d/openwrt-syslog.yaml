# OpenWrt System Syslog Acquisition
# This configuration monitors OpenWrt system logs via syslog
# For local log files or syslog forwarding scenarios
#
# Note: OpenWrt uses logd by default which doesn't write to files.
# Enable syslog-ng or configure log_file in /etc/config/system
# to enable file-based log acquisition.
#
# Required collections:
#   cscli collections install crowdsecurity/linux
#   cscli parsers install crowdsecurity/syslog-logs

# File-based acquisition for syslog
# The init script configures OpenWrt to write logs to /var/log/messages
filenames:
  - /var/log/messages
labels:
  type: syslog
---
# Alternative: Syslog service acquisition
# Uncomment this section if using remote syslog forwarding
# or if CrowdSec should act as a syslog server
